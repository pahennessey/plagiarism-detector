# Plagiarism detection through PyTorch mediated classification from various length n-gram containment and longest common subsequence (LCS) calculations

This project uses AWS-based Sagemaker to train and serve a plagiarism detector using PyTorch

## Pipeline / Feature Engineering

### Build containment calculations from n-grams betwen 1 and 6

### Build Longest Common Subsequence feature using dynamic programming

### Feature selection based on low collinearity

## Model building

## Sagemaker training and serving
